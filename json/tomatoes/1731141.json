If not for the legendary heroics of International Fleet Commander Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley), all would have been lost. In preparation for the next attack, the highly esteemed Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) and the International Military are training only the best young children to find the future Mazer. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a shy, but strategically brilliant boy is pulled out of his school to join the elite. Arriving at Battle School, Ender quickly and easily masters increasingly difficult war games, distinguishing himself and winning respect amongst his peers. Ender is soon ordained by Graff as the military's next great hope, resulting in his promotion to Command School. Once there, he's trained by Mazer Rackham, himself, to lead his fellow soldiers into an epic battle that will determine the future of Earth and save the human race. Based on the best-selling, award winning novel, ENDER'S GAME is an epic adventure which stars Asa Butterfield, Hailee Steinfeld, Ben Kingsley, Viola Davis, with Abigail Breslin and Harrison Ford. -- (C) Summit","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/62/11176212_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/62/11176212_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/62/11176212_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/62/11176212_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Asa Butterfield","id":"770800323","characters":["Ender Wiggin"]},{"name":"Harrison Ford","id":"162661579","characters":["Colonel Hyrum Graff"]},{"name":"Hailee Steinfeld","id":"771070631","characters":["Petra Arkanian"]},{"name":"Abigail Breslin","id":"162653854","characters":["Valentine Wiggin"]},{"name":"Ben Kingsley","id":"162653703","characters":["Mazer Rackham"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Gavin Hood"}],"studio":"Summit Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0400403"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enders-game/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035/similar.json"}}
